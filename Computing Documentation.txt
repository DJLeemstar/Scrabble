	- Call other Methods; All other areas are called from here.
	- Short + Simple.

- Randomise 7 Characters
	
	Structures needed (MUST use Arrays, not Dicts/Lists):
	- Array containing every character; Ensure they are limited as in Scrabble. 
	- Random; 
	- WriteLine; Show them to the user.
	
	- Pass this by Ref to change the original array. Function.

- Intake input from the user and check if the word can be made with the characters
	
	Structures:
	- "For i In"; Iterate input characters.
	- "If... In"; If returns false, then have function return that. 
	- "Else"... It has returned true, and the user has entered a correct word.

	- Return boolean by value. Function.
	- THIS WILL BE THE MODULE USED FOR THE PSEUDOCODE.
